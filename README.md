# Fraud-Detection
Detecting fraud using ensemble of statistical models 

Problem Statement:
A lending company wants to minimize losses due to customer defaults by identifying high-risk customers early. They have historical loan data for 2400 customers, including loan duration, amount, interest rate, and other loan characteristics. The data also includes qualitative variables such as loan reason and quality score. The company has provided a training set of 2000+ customers and a test set of 500+ customers. The task is to build a risk score (probability of default) for each customer in the test set using statistical models, without using deep learning, random forests, or boosting. The final model should be selected based on the writeup that describes the approach and the importance of variables. The Mean Absolute error (MAE) should also be provided for the test dataset, where the MAE is defined as 0 (amount) if there is no default in the test set for a customer.
